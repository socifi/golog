# Go logging facility

Based on [Apex log](https://github.com/apex/log) with few tweaks. Unless otherwise noted (mainly in `pkg.go`), this package should be thread safe. Just for the record the architecture leaves almost all thread safety on handlers so if you are uncertain, consult the documentation and code of handlers you use.

## Functionality

### Autogenerated levels

This package contains python script for log level automatic generation. The script contains default values used in SOCIFI but can be easily tweaked to generate entirely custom level names and level numbers. Just alter the level names and level codes at the top of the file `gen_levels.py` and run it. It will take care about everything else (unless you deleted guideline comments).

### Hooks

This package allows registering of hooks which will be run for every field in entry to check specific things in field name and then apply some function to it's content. It's incredibly useful e.g. for password hiding in logs. Example implementations of hooks are in folder `hook/` and amongst them is a dsn hook which will check if a field name contains `dsn` (case insensitive). This package will then try to convert dsn interface to string and hide password in it. Rationale behind this is that some informations might be very useful in troubleshooting some problems but logging passwords is very bad practice. This feature is entirely opt-in and might be included by importing module dsn as such:
```golang
import(
	// ...
	"github.com/socifi/go-logging-facility"
	_ "github.com/socifi/go-logging-facility/hook/dsn"
	// ...
)
```

#### How to write a hook

Hook is an interface with two functions. First one is `Check(string) bool` which takes field name as parameter and returns if the field should be processed or not. The other function is `Sanitize(interface{}) interface{}` which takes a field value and does some processing on it and returns processed interface which will be saved or sent to logging service.

```golang
package hook

import (
	"github.com/socifi/go-logging-facility"
	"strings"
)

type hook struct{}

var h hook

// Register hook to the mechanism
func init() {
	log.RegisterSanitizeHook(h)
}

func (dsn) Check(s string) bool {
	// string.Contains was chosen for simplicity, any logic can be here
	if strings.Contains(strings.ToLower(s), "password") {
		return true
	}
	return false
}

func (dsn) Sanitize(v interface{}) interface{} {
	// In case it's impossible to convert to chosen typ fall back
	s, ok := v.(string)
	if !ok {
		return v
	}

	// Again any logic (e.g. regex) can be here, this is for simplicity
	s = "***"

	return s
}
```

### Atexit

Inspired by [atexit module](github.com/tebeka/atexit) go logging facility also offers possibility to register a function which will be run on system exit. However this functionality has the same caveat as atexit, the program needs to closed with any `Exit(code int)` function in this module. This function as well as `AddExitHandler(handler func())` which registers functions to be run on program exit is defined for both module, logger and entry.

A side note: To access local variables use closures:

```golang
	// ...
	a := "something"
	log.AddExitHandler( func() {
		fmt.Println(a)
	})
	// ...

	// End the program
	log.Exit(0)
```


### Simple logger initialization from config json

There is also initialization script which allows simple load of configuration needed by logger. This feature is now limited to json, text and elastic handlers and might be changed in the future to allow better interoperability with e.g. [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)

## Handlers

Some handlers which support only fixed number of log levels have been discarded and only these are left. PR for simple text handler which is able to process any number of levels is welcome.

- __discard__ – discards all logs
- __es__ – Elasticsearch handler
- __init__ – Initialization script
- __json__ – JSON output handler
- __kinesis__ – AWS Kinesis handler
- __level__ – level filter handler
- __logfmt__ – logfmt plain-text formatter
- __memory__ – in-memory handler for tests
- __multi__ – fan-out to multiple handlers
- __papertrail__ – Papertrail handler
